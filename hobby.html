            Adequate sleep is crucial for both physical and mental well-being.
            It supports various bodily functions, including brain function,
            heart health, weight management, and immune system strength. Sleep
            also plays a vital role in mood regulation, cognitive abilities, and
            reducing the risk of chronic diseases.
